# Node JS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose Adventure

Create an API with pagination using the services on top. I will learn to work with a backend using TypeScript as well as re-learn how to work with mongoDB locally as the community version of MongoDB is available in Focal Fossa now.

## Goals

-  Use a local instance of MongoDB
-  Work using TypeScript with Mongoose
-  Create a REST API with pagination using skip() and also range queries
-  Use this API for future testing and React Infinite Scroll

### Gold Plating

-  Work with passport and TypeScript
-  Secure the API with better practices
